# 🧩 DSA Practice Repository (Pattern-Wise)

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** solutions solved using a **pattern-based approach**, inspired by real interview questions from platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and others.

Instead of organizing problems topic-wise, I focus on **problem-solving patterns** to improve recognition, efficiency, and interview performance.
